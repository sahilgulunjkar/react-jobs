# React + Vite + Tailwind CRUD Practice Project

A practice project built using **React, Vite, and Tailwind CSS**.  
This project was done while learning from a YouTube tutorial and expanding it with routing, components, and basic CRUD operations.

---

## 📌 Overview
This project helped me understand:
- React folder structure (Pages, Components, Assets)
- Routing & navigation between pages
- useState / useEffect for UI logic & API fetch
- CRUD operations for a job listing style UI

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1️⃣ Install dependencies
```bash
npm install
````

### 2️⃣ Start development server

```bash
npm run dev
```

### 3️⃣ (Optional) Start backend if configured

```bash
npm run server   # (if Node backend is set to port 8000)
```

## 🔧 Tech Stack

* **React + Vite** → Frontend & fast build tool
* **Tailwind CSS** → Utility-based styling
* **React Router** → Page navigation
* **Node.js (optional)** → Backend API for CRUD

---

## 🧠 Concepts Learned

* JSX components and props
* State handling with `useState`
* Side effects & API fetching with `useEffect`
* Folder structure for scalable apps
* CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)

Build command:

```bash
npm run build
```
